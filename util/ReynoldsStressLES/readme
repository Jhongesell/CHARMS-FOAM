   
    It cCalculates and writes the full Reynolds stress R for the current time step.

    It is only for LES simulations. For RANS simulutionls, use the generic R tool.

    In the current setup of OpenFOAM, there is no direct way to calcualte the Reynolds 
    stress. To use this tool, a LES solver should record the R field and do statistics on it.
    This tool will read a field called RMean (from fieldAverage) and add the contribution to the 
    resolved part.
