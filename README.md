-----------------------------------------------------------------------
0. CHARMS-FOAM is a repository of computational hydraulics models and tools developed in OpenFOAM.
0. These modoles and tools are mosltly produced by Dr. Xiaofeng Liu's Environmental Fluid Dynamics Group at Penn State University, with contributions from his collaborators and other parties.
0. The aim is to have an open-source, versatile, expandable and reusable modeling suites for hydraulics and evironmental problems.
0. New models will be added over time.


Large repository of computational hydraulics models for:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
0. free-surface open channel flow
1. sediment transport (bedload and suspended load)
2. erosion and scour
3. buoyancy flows (density/turbidity currents)
4. shallow-water equation
5. porous media flows
6. immersed boundary method for complex geometries
7. rigid body dynamics (coupled with third-party code)

Limitations:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
0. Most of codes are developed either in OpenFOAM v2.2 or 2.3. To use them with other OpenFOAM versions, some modifications may be necessary.
1. Some codes may have been developed using even older version of OpenFOAM. Help is welcome to modernized these codes.
